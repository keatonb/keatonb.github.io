Heading into the new year, I'm finally striking off something that has been on the to-do list for a long time: setting up a personal blog space.  I don't anticipate that this will be a particularly active place or of general interest, but I hope that the content is occasionally of use to other researchers.  This will host digital excerpts of my physical research journal, general results that weren't easy to find on Google, answers to StackExchange questions that no one is asking. Snore.
