Welcome to my blog.  I am an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at the DiRAC Institute of the University of Washington.  I study various sources of time-domain photometric variability of stars, particulatly stellar pulsations and exoplanet transits.  You can read more about my work at [my main website](http://staff.washington.edu/keatonb/).

I set up this blog to host short, generally non-astronomy-specific public notes that might prove useful to others.  These are things that I wish had been easier to Google when I needed the answers.  I will mostly post statistical, mathematical, programming, and data visualization tricks that I developed in the course of my research. I may also publish the results of some just-for-fun data science experiments on this site.
