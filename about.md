Welcome to my blog.  I am a postdoctoral researcher of stellar astrophysics at the Max Plank Institute for Solar System Research.  I study stellar pulsations in order to understand the interiors of stars.  You can read more about my work at my main [website](http://www2.mps.mpg.de/homes/bell/).

I set up this blog to host short, non-astronomy-specific public notes that might prove useful to others.  These are things that I wish had been easier to Google when I needed the answers.  I will mostly post statistical, mathematical, and data visualization tricks that I developed in the course of my research. I may also publish the results of some just-for-fun data science experiments on this site.
